/**
 * Leetcode Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * Topics: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the length of the input string.
 * Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)) - where m is the size of the character set and n is the length of the input string.
 * Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 * Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
 * Hint: Use a sliding window approach with two pointers to track the current substring and a hash set to check for repeating characters.
