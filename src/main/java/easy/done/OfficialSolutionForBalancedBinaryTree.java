/**
 * LeetCode Problem 110: Balanced Binary Tree
 * Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (for the recursive DFS approach).
 * <p>
 * This class provides a method to check if a binary tree is balanced.
 * A balanced binary tree is defined as a tree where the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.
 * The main method demonstrates the usage of the isBalanced method.
 * The TreeNode class is a simple representation of a binary tree node.
 * Hint: A balanced binary tree is one where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
 * The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node.
 * If the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by more than one, the tree is not balanced.
