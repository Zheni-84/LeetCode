/**
 * LeetCode Problem 222: Count Complete Tree Nodes
 * Time Complexity: O(log(n) * log(n)), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of space.
 * Topic: Binary Tree, Height Calculation
 *
 * This class provides a method to count the number of nodes in a complete binary tree.
 * The main method demonstrates the usage of the countNodes method.
 * The TreeNode class is a simple representation of a binary tree node.
 * Hint: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
